<h3>What you'll need!</h3>
<p><img src="../Images/ingredientsrice.jpg" alt="Ingredients" width="300" height="200" ><br> <br>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of rice (short-grain or Arborio works best)</li>
        <li>4 cups of milk (whole milk for creaminess, but you can use almond or coconut milk for a twist)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of sugar (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon (optional, but why not?)</li>
        <li>Raisins or nuts for topping (totally optional, but they add a nice crunch)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Let’s Get Cooking </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, combine the rice, milk, sugar, salt, and cinnamon. Bring it to a gentle boil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 20-25 minutes or until the rice is tender and the mixture is creamy. If it gets too thick, add a splash more milk.</li>
        <li>Stir in the vanilla extract and let it cool slightly before serving.</li>
        <li>Top with raisins or nuts if you like, and sprinkle a little extra cinnamon on top for good measure.</li>
        <li>Serve warm or chilled, and enjoy the cozy vibes!</li>
    </ol>
